# Pull Request Workflow

1. Do the work in a dedicated feature worktree (see
   [SKILL.md](../SKILL.md#hard-guardrails)'s checkout-safety guardrail) —
   never on `main`, never in the primary checkout.
2. Run [verify.md](verify.md) before opening or updating the PR.
3. Open the PR with `jlapenna` as reviewer:

   ```bash
   gh pr create --reviewer jlapenna
   ```

   `jlapenna` is this repo's maintainer for every purpose a PR review, a
   parking assignee (see the [lcars](../../lcars/SKILL.md) skill for the
   headless-dispatch parking recipe), or a fleet-claim escalation might
   need — the same login across interactive and headless sessions.

4. A PR authored by one of the agent bot identities listed in the
   `AGENT_BOT_LOGINS` repo variable (currently `claude[bot]` and
   `agent-lcars[bot]`) squash-auto-merges once the ruleset's required
   `Verify` check goes green (`.github/workflows/agent-automerge.yml`) — see
   the [lcars](../../lcars/SKILL.md) skill for the exact mechanism and how
   to register a new pipeline's bot login. A human-authored or
   interactively-driven PR merges normally through GitHub's own review
   flow.
